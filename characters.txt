Jay Gatsby
The Enigmatic Millionaire:

Jay Gatsby, the titular character of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, is shrouded in mystery.
A young Midwesterner named James Gatz at birth, he reinvents himself as the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby on Long Island.
Gatsby throws extravagant parties in his luxurious mansion, but no one truly knows the source of his fortune (rumors swirl about bootlegging and organized crime).
Gatsby's obsessive dream is to recapture the past and win back Daisy Buchanan, his lost love from a bygone era.
Nick Carraway
The Midwestern Observer:

Nick Carraway, the narrator of The Great Gatsby, is a young man from the Midwest who rents a modest house next to Gatsby's extravagant mansion.
Nick becomes entangled in Gatsby's world and acts as a guide for the reader, offering a unique perspective on the wealthy and disillusioned characters who inhabit the East Egg social scene.
Nick is drawn to Gatsby's charm and optimism, but also becomes increasingly aware of the moral decay beneath the glittering surface.
Daisy Buchanan
The Beautiful Socialite:

Daisy Buchanan, the object of Gatsby's relentless desire, embodies the careless glamour of the Jazz Age.
Married to the wealthy and arrogant Tom Buchanan, Daisy seems to represent everything Gatsby aspires to.
However, beneath her charming facade lies a deep emptiness and a yearning for a romantic past that may never have truly existed.
Thomas "Tom" Buchanan
The Old Money Arrogance:

Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband, is the epitome of old money arrogance.
Wealthy, careless, and racist, Tom represents the established social order that Gatsby longs to be a part of.
His blatant infidelity exposes the hypocrisy that underlies the East Egg social scene.
